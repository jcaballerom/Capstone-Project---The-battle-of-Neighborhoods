# Capstone-Project---The-battle-of-Neighborhoods

4 years ago I opened an Instagram business account that I used it as a personal blog. Since then I’m documenting all my visits to local breweries around Mexico (Chihuahua, Baja California, CDMX, Guadalajara) and the US (Texas, Washington state, Oregon).

	I started my project in Mexico, and then when I move to Washington state 3 years ago I have been continue with this activity around the US being Washington state the headquarters of my blog activity.

	I want to continue with my personal blog to try different kind of beers (every single brewery has it’s unique and seasonal kind of beer), tell people about the local breweries and crafted beer located around the world, make of this personal blog a profitable business in the future and allow me to travel around the world.

	Actually, Washington state has 430 breweries around it’s huge territory. The most located in the Seattle area, according to the Washington state craft beer website (https://washingtonbeer.com/breweries/). This website distribute brochures throughout Washington state for tourist or craft beer enthusiasts to visit the breweries located in the state.

	Everything is fine so far, but some of the information in the brochures is outdated. So, if you don’t know about the breweries located on Washington state or the existence of the web site, you are going to waste a lot of time trying to look for breweries and find that some are already closed or have been moved.

	So, to fix this problem I’m going to use the Foursquare API to have updated information about the breweries located in Washington State and in future locations, to update this task and make it easier for further enthusiasts.
